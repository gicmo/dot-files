/* Keybindings for emacs emulation.  Compiled by Jacob Rus.
 *
 * This is a pretty good set, especially considering that many emacs bindings
 * such as C-o, C-a, C-e, C-k, C-y, C-v, C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-t, and
 * perhaps a few more, are already built into the system.
 *
 * BEWARE:
 * This file uses the Option key as a meta key.  This has the side-effect
 * of overriding Mac OS keybindings for the option key, which generally
 * make common symbols and non-english letters.
